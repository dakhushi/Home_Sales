# Home Sales Data Analysis with SparkSQL

## Overview
This challange involves analyzing home sales data using SparkSQL to derive key metrics and insights. The main objectives are to calculate average home prices based on specific criteria and to optimize query performance through caching and partitioning.

## Repository Structure
- **Home_Sales_colab.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis code and results.
- **home_sales_revised.csv**: The dataset used for analysis.
Home_sales_revised.csv data into a Spark DataFrame.

## Findings
**1. What is the average price for a four-bedroom house sold for each year? Round off your answer to two decimal places.**

**2. What is the average price of a home for each year it was built that has three bedrooms and three bathrooms? Round off your answer to two decimal places.**

**3. What is the average price of a home for each year that has three bedrooms, three bathrooms, two floors, and is greater than or equal to 2,000 square feet? Round off your answer to two decimal places.**

**4.What is the "view" rating for homes costing more than or equal to $350,000? Determine the run time for this query, and round off your answer to two decimal places.**

**5. Using the cached data, run the query that filters out the view ratings with an average price of greater than or equal to $350,000. Determine the runtime and compare it to uncached runtime.**

Both the cached data and the Parquet formatted data have faster runtimes compared to the original data .

In conclusion, cached data and the Parquet formatted data demonstrates the best runtime among the three options (Run time for original data, cached data and parquet formatted data).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Home_Sales.git
   cd Home_Sales
